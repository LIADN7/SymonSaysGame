# Symon Says - Color Sequence Challenge

## Description

Symon Says - Color Sequence Challenge is an exciting memory and reaction game designed to test and enhance players' memory skills and their ability to follow instructions. Players must accurately replicate a dynamically evolving sequence of colors displayed by the computer.

## Gameplay

- **Displaying the Initial Color:** The game begins with the computer showcasing a single color on the screen, setting the foundation for the color sequence.

- **Adding Colors:** With each successive round, the computer introduces an additional color to the sequence. Players must memorize and replicate the entire sequence, including the new color.

- **Player's Turn:** After the color sequence is displayed, it's the player's turn to recreate it. Players achieve this by clicking or tapping on the colors in the precise order they were originally presented.

- **Progression and Difficulty:** As the game advances, the color sequences become progressively longer and more intricate, challenging players' memory and concentration.

## Game End Conditions

The game concludes under the following circumstances:
- The player makes an incorrect move by clicking on the wrong color or failing to adhere to the sequence's order.
- Alternatively, the game can also end upon reaching a predefined time limit.

## Leaderboard

- **Scoring and Ranking:** At the game's conclusion, players' scores are calculated based on their progress in replicating the color sequence. Players achieving top scores secure a place on the leaderboard.

- **Top Performers:** The leaderboard showcases the top-performing players and their respective scores. Achieving a high score earns players a spot on the leaderboard, allowing them to engage in spirited competition and vie for a coveted position in the top three.

## Objective and Strategy
